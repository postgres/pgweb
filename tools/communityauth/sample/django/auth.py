#
# Django module to support postgresql.org community authentication 2.0
#
# The main location for this module is the pgweb git repository hosted
# on git.postgresql.org - look there for updates.
#
# To integrate with django, you need the following:
# * Make sure the view "login" from this module is used for login
# * Map an url somwehere (typically /auth_receive/) to the auth_receive
#   view.
# * To get notified when a user is created from upstream, connect to the signal
#   auth_user_created_from_upstream.
# * To receive live updates (not just during login), map an url somewhere
#   (typically /auth_api/) to the auth_api view.
# * To receive live updates, also connect to the signal auth_user_data_received.
#   This signal will fire *both* on login events *and* on background updates.
# * In settings.py, set AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS to point to the class
#   AuthBackend in this module.
# * (And of course, register for a crypto key with the main authentication
#   provider website)
# * If the application uses the django admin interface, the login screen
#   has to be replaced with something similar to login.html in this
#   directory (adjust urls, and name it admin/login.html in any template
#   directory that's processed before the default django.contrib.admin)
#
