Development install
===================

So, you're ready to contribute to pgweb, and you want to set up a
local working copy of the website code, so you have something to work
with. Here's a quick step-by-step on how to do that:

#. Make sure you have downloaded and installed django *version 1.4*
   You will also need the dependencies *psycopg2*, *yaml*
   and *markdown* (these are python libraries, so prefix python- for Debian
   packages, for example). There is a `requirements.txt` file available
   for pip installs.

#. Make sure you have downloaded and installed PostgreSQL (tested only
   with *version 9.0* and later, but doesn't use any advanced
   functionality so it should work with other versions)

#. Create a database in your PostgreSQL installation called pgweb
   (other names are of course possible, but that's the standard one)

#. Create a file called settings_local.py, located in the pgweb
   directory (next to settings.py). This file will contain any settings
   you override from the main settings one. Normally, you will want to
   override the following::

	DEBUG=True
	TEMPLATE_DEBUG=DEBUG
	SITE_ROOT="http://localhost:8000"
	NO_HTTPS_REDIRECT=True
	SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False
	SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN=None
        DATABASE_NAME="pgweb"
#. In the pgweb directory run the following command to create all
   tables and indexes, as well as create a superuser for your local
   installation::

   ./manage.py syncdb

#. A few functions are required, or at least recommended in order to
   test all of the system. The SQL scripts in the directory sql/ needs
   to be run in the database. Run *compat_tables.sql* before
   *community_login.sql* Note that for a local dev instal without varnish
   frontends, you should use the *varnish_local.sql* script, and not use the
   *varnish.sql* script.

#. To load some initial data for some tables (far from all at this
   point), in the pgweb directory, run the following command after making sure
   you have PyYAML installed::

   ./load_initial_data.sh
#. At this point, you're ready to get started. Start your local server
   by running::

   ./manage.py runserver
#. Now load up the website by going to http://localhost:8000

Future improvements
-------------------
The plan is to make it possible to get a good snapshot of the actual
PostgreSQL website to do development work on, including parts from the
database. However, there are a number of privacy issues that need to
be figured out before we can do that (we don't want to put a
database-dump containing thousands of well confirmed email addresses
easily available for download, for example). Any suggestions on
exactly how to get this done are much appreciated.
