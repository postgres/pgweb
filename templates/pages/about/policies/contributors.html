<h1>Recognized Contributors <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>

<p>
  The PostgreSQL <a href="/community/contributors/">Contributor Profiles</a> page
  includes people who have made substantial, long-term contributions of time
  and effort to the PostgreSQL project. One-time-only or short-term contributions
  are not usually considered adequate for listing, unless they involve quite large
  amounts of code and time. Financial contributions get listed on the
  <a href="/about/sponsors/">Sponsors</a> pages, not here.
</p>

<h2>Committee Governance</h2>
<p>
  The current method of choosing who qualifies as a Contributor is via
  simple majority vote of those on the committee. The size and membership
  of the Committee is self determined, but ratified by a simple majority
  vote of the Core Team. Generally the goal is that there be a minimum of
  three people, with no single company employing a majority of the
  committee membership.
