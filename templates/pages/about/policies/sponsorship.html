<h1>PostgreSQL Sponsorship <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>

<p><em>Last updated: June 1, 2018. {%git_changes_link%}</em></p>

<h2>Sponsorship levels</h2>

<p>There are two levels of PostgreSQL Sponsors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Minor sponsors</strong> indicate organizations which have provided notable
        contributions in recent years.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Major sponsors</strong> indicate organizations that have provided
        significant and/or sustaining contributions over many years.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Contributions to the PostgreSQL Project that may be considered by the
    committee include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Funding of feature development, review, documentation, advocacy,
        administration, or other recognized needs of the project.
    </li>
    <li>Employing staff to work on the PostgreSQL Project.</li>
    <li>Providing servers and/or hosting for testing or project
        infrastructure.
    </li>
    <li>Contributing to recognized PostgreSQL Open Source "ecosystem" projects
        such as drivers, extensions, graphical tools, and advocacy.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Sponsorship for PostgreSQL events will not be considered in determining
    PostgreSQL sponsorship levels.</p>

<p>All sponsorship recognition is at the discretion of the Sponsor Committee,
    who will decide on the status of each sponsor or potential sponsor on an
    individual basis. In exceptional circumstances, a contributor may be
    recognised at a sponsorship level for outstanding contributions over a
    period of time lower than the above stated durations. The decision of the
    committee is final.</p>

<h2>Sponsorship Committee</h2>

<p>Using the guidelines above, sponsorship is ultimately determined by the
    Sponsorship committee. The current members are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Tatsuo Ishii</li>
    <li>Jonathan S. Katz</li>
    <li>Ilya Kosmodemiansky</li>
    <li>Dave Page</li>
    <li>Robert Treat</li>
</ul>

<p>The current method of choosing who qualifies as a sponsor is via simple
    majority vote of those in the committee.</p>
