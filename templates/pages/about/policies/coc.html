    <h1>Code of Conduct <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>

    <p><em>Last updated: October 4, 2024. {%git_changes_link%}</em></p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The PostgreSQL Project prides itself on the quality of our code and our work,
        and the technical and professional accomplishments of our community. We
        expect everyone who participates to conduct themselves in a professional
        manner, acting with common courtesy and in the common interest, with respect
        for all users and developers.</p>

    <p>To that end, we have established this Code of Conduct for community
        interaction and participation in the projectâ€™s work and the community at
        large. This Code is meant to cover all interaction between community
        members, whether or not it takes place within postgresql.org infrastructure,
        so long as there is not another Code of Conduct that takes precedence (such
        as a conference's Code of Conduct).</p>

    <h2>Inclusivity and Appropriate Conduct</h2>

    <p>The PostgreSQL Project is open to participation by anyone with an interest in
        working with PostgreSQL, regardless of their level of experience with the
        software, or with technology in general. We encourage development and
        contributions from all users, whatever their background may be.</p>

    <p>We encourage thoughtful, constructive discussion of the software and this
        community, their current state, and possible directions for development. The
        focus of our discussions should be the code and related technology,
        community projects, and infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Personal attacks and negative comments on personal characteristics are
        unacceptable, and will not be permitted. Examples of personal
        characteristics include, but are not limited to age, race, national origin
        or ancestry, religion, gender, or sexual orientation.</p>

    <p>Additional behaviors which are also violations of this code of conduct
        include, but are not limited to, threats of violence against an individual
        or group, threats of professional, community, and/or project sabotage,
        unwelcome sexual attentions in any form, engaging in behavior that may
        bring the PostgreSQL project into disrepute, and refusing to cease
        inappropriate conduct when requested to do so.</p>

    <h2>Retaliation</h2>

    <p>It is also expressly forbidden for anyone to retaliate against a person who
        brings a complaint under this Code of Conduct, or who assists in
        investigating such a complaint. Retaliation may take the form of, among
        other actions:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>further personal attacks (public or private);</li>
        <li>actions which undermine an individual's professional status and/or
            status with their employer, coworkers, clients, or community;</li>
        <li>actions which threaten the individual's privacy, physical person,
            well-being, home, and/or family.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Acts of retaliation will be treated in the same manner as any other violation
        of this Code of Conduct.</p>

    <h2>Code of Conduct Committee</h2>

    <p>The Core Team will appoint a Code of Conduct Committee to receive and
        investigate all complaints, and a Chair for that Committee. Any member of
        the community may volunteer to be on the Committee, with the exception of
        Core Team members. As the Core Team oversees the Committee, Core Team
        members will not serve on the Committee to prevent conflicts of interest.
        The membership list of the Committee will be publicly available at all times
        and can be viewed <a href="/about/policies/coc_committee/">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The Committee membership will be refreshed on an annual basis. The Core Team
        or the Committee Chair will announce the opening and closing dates of the
        annual membership selection process through the usual community channels of
        communication.</p>

    <p>Any community member who would like to serve on the Committee will complete
        an initial questionnaire for review by the Core Team and the current
        Committee. The current Committee members will review the candidates, and
        conduct interviews if needed. The current Committee will make
        recommendations, and the Core Team will choose the new members for the
        Committee.</p>

    <p>The Committee may have a transition period of up to one month to allow
        transfer of knowledge and responsibilities between the retiring members
        and the new members.</p>

    <p>While there is no specified number of Committee members who may serve at any
        one time, the Committee will consist of at least four individuals at all
        times. A term for a Committee member is one (1) year. A Committee member
        may serve no more than three (3) terms consecutively.</p>

    <p>Committee members serve at the pleasure of the Core Team, and the Core Team
        may relieve a Committee member of their duties if the Core Team believes
        that member is not meeting the responsibilities of their position.</p>

    <p>The Committee may also approach the Core Team to coordinate removal of a
        member on their own initiative if such person is unable or unwilling to
        fulfill the responsibilities of their position.</p>

    <h2>Reporting</h2>

    <p>If you are the recipient of inappropriate behavior, or witness such behavior,
        please report it promptly to the Code of Conduct Committee at
        <a href="mailto:coc@postgresql.org">coc@postgresql.org</a>. In the
        unfortunate event that you wish to make a complaint against some member of
        the Committee, you may instead contact any of the other Committee member(s)
        individually.</p>

    <p>In your report, please include as much detail as possible:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>a description of the incident;</li>
        <li>the timing of events;</li>
        <li>screen shots of any electronic discussions;</li>
        <li>names, and if possible, contact information for any witnesses; and,</li>
        <li>any other information which you think would be helpful in the investigation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Handling of Complaints</h2>

    <p>The Committee will promptly acknowledge and investigate each reported
        incident. With the cooperation of all parties, the Committee will aim to
        complete the investigation in a period of two weeks from the receipt of the
        complaint.</p>

    <p>Incident reports and investigation activities will be kept confidential to
        the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate
        investigation.</p>

    <p>The Committee will inform the complainant and the alleged violator of their
        decision at that time. If the investigation is still ongoing, the Committee
        will give the parties a status report and an estimated completion date.</p>

    <p>A lack of cooperation could prolong the investigation. The Committee will
        make every effort to complete the investigation and deliver the results to
        the complainant and the alleged violator as soon as practicable, notifying
        them of its decision when the investigation is completed.</p>

    <p>In the event of a complaint by or against a CoC Committee member or Core Team
        member, the complaint handling will proceed as usual, with the exception
        that the person who is involved in the complaint will be excluded from the
        proceedings in their role on the Committee or Core Team.</p>

    <p>Possible results include, but are not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A determination of no violation of the Code of Conduct;</li>
        <li>A private reprimand with specific guidance on acceptable behavior to the
            individual(s) involved;</li>
        <li>A public reprimand with specific guidance on acceptable behavior to the
            individual(s);</li>
        <li>A temporary or permanent ban from some or all community-managed spaces,
            including, but not limited to, community mailing lists, forums, IRC, and
            loss of commit privileges;</li>
        <li>A determination for a public and/or private apology.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because of the seriousness of a determination involving a temporary or
        permanent ban, and the associated technical and infrastructure actions
        required by such a result, such a finding would be subject to review by the
        Core Team before the involved parties are informed of the decision. If the
        Core Team disagrees with the Committee's finding, the Core Team would
        present its reasoning to the Committee. The Committee would consider the
        Core Team's recommendations, and engage in further discussion if needed.
        If the Core Team and Committee cannot agree on a determination, the Core
        Team's decision would prevail.</p>

    <p>The Committee may determine that a violation of this policy was inadvertent,
        perhaps arising from cultural differences (for example, use of a slang term
        which is harmless in one language and offensive in another) or a misguided
        attempt at humor. Such cases will be treated as opportunities for education
        rather than reprimand. If the Committee determines that a reported incident
        falls into the category of inadvertent violation, the Committee will decide
        whether the incident is likely to be repeated by others, and, if so, share
        the information in a general way with the community to prevent further
        incidents.</p>

    <p>If either party feels the determination is incorrect, an appeal may be filed
        with the Committee within one week of its decision. The appeal should
        include new information, sources, witnesses, etc. to provide the Committee
        with additional information to re-consider the incident.</p>

    <p>Records of incident reports, investigations, Committee decisions, and all
        related matters will be retained for a period of three calendar years from
        the date of the last item in the incident file. The Committee will take
        suitable measures to ensure the confidentiality of all reports and
        discussions.</p>

    <p>The Committee will produce an annual report summarizing the types of
        complaints received and the actions taken to address the complaints by the
        end of the first quarter of each year for the prior year, and share that
        report with the community. The complaints and actions will be anonymized to
        protect the identities of all involved parties.</p>

    <h2>Acting in Good Faith</h2>

    <p>Anyone filing a complaint concerning an incident is expected to be acting in
        good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information
        disclosed indicates a violation of this policy. Any allegations that prove
        not to be substantiated, and which prove to have been made maliciously or
        knowingly to be false, will be viewed as a serious community offense and a
        violation of this Code of Conduct.</p>

    <h2>Updates to the Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>The Committee and/or the Core Team will consider updates to this Code of
        Conduct as needed, and at least once per year, based on incidents reported,
        recommendations from legal professionals, suggestions from community
        members, community cultural developments, or other events which create a
        need for revision.</p>

    <p>Community members who have a suggestion for a revision to the Code of Conduct
        may submit their ideas to the Committee via email to
        <a href="mailto:coc@postgresql.org">coc@postgresql.org</a>.</p>

    <h2>Conferences and Events</h2>

    <p>The project encourages each event organizer to create and maintain a Code of
        Conduct for their event. Those Codes of Conduct may or may not be identical
        to this Code of Conduct. Each event organizer is responsible for handling
        inappropriate conduct at their event in a prompt and objective manner.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>We encourage appropriate and collegial relationships among community members;
        however, members must be sensitive to conduct that may be considered
        offensive by fellow members and must refrain from engaging in such
        conduct.</p>

    <p>In all interactions with the community, use your professional judgment, and
        keep the discussion focused on moving our project and our community forward
        in a positive direction for all.</p>
