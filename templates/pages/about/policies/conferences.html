<h1>Community Conference Recognition <i class="fas fa-gavel"></i></h1>

<p><em>Last updated: September 21, 2023. {%git_changes_link%} <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgweb.git;a=history;f=templates/pages/community/recognition.html">View</a> history before December 8, 2020.</em></p>

<p>The Community Conference Recognition programme is a voluntary scheme under which submitters of events to the <a href="/about/events/">PostgreSQL Website listings</a> may self-assess their entry against the criteria below, and if they comply may market their event as a PostgreSQL Community event.</p>

<p>Events that do not meet the criteria will still be welcomed (where appropriate under the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/NewsEventsApproval#Approving_Events_and_Event-Related_News_.28excluding_training.29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general listing policies</a>) - for example, events organised by a single company which may still be valuable for people to attend, but are not necessarily what we would consider fully "open."</p>

<p>Use of the terms "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "SHOULD NOT" in the criteria below should be interpreted per <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC2119</a>.</p>

<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The event MUST be primarily focused on PostgreSQL and targeted at existing and/or potential developers and users of PostgreSQL.</li>
  <li>The event MUST adopt and follow an appropriate Code of Conduct to ensure a safe and enjoyable environment for anyone who wishes to attend.</li>
  <li>The event website, advertisements, notices, and any other related material MUST fully comply with the <a href="/about/policies/trademarks/">PostgreSQL Trademark Policy</a> or receive permission from the <a href="https://www.postgres.ca/">PostgreSQL Community Association</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/developer/core/">PostgreSQL Core Team</a> reserves the right to recognise, not recognise, or rescind a previous recognition for any event without justification.</li>
  <li>Information that is required to be publicly disclosed MUST be available on the website of the event, or, if it is not possible to publish to the eventâ€™s website, MUST be made available in the <a href="/about/events/">PostgreSQL Website events list</a>.</li>
  <li>Events are self-certified as complying with these criteria when <a href="/about/events/">listed on the PostgreSQL Website</a>. If an event is self-certified by the organisers and later found not to comply with the criteria, the <a href="/developer/core/">PostgreSQL Core Team</a> reserves the right to rescind the recognition of the event as a community event and, where appropriate, take further action up to a permanent ban on future event listings from the organisers.</li>
  <li>These criteria may be reviewed and potentially updated at any time.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Organisers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The organizing committee (also referred to as a steering committee) MUST be fully disclosed on the event website OR the PostgreSQL Website event listing.</li>

  <li>Solicited or sponsor presentations may bypass the normal talk selection process, but MUST be approved by a majority of the talk selection committee.</li>
  <li>The full talk selection process and voting system MUST be fully disclosed to all members of the talk selection committee.</li>
  <li>Details of the talk selection process and how results were obtained MUST be provided to the <a href="/developer/core/">PostgreSQL Core Team</a> on request.</li>

Any financial statements shared with the Core Team will not be distributed by the Core Team to any 3rd parties without written permission from the event organisers or where required by court order or other forms of legal authority.</li>
  <li>
    A statement on the event website MUST indicate where any profits from the event will go, which specifically MUST support PostgreSQL community activities, either through:
    <ol>
