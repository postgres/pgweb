			"And the winner is PostgreSQL. This one surprised us and taught us something about our audience base. We need to do a better job of covering this topic! Postgresql.org touts this product as "The world's most advanced open source database" and after seeing the votes, they may just be correct."

			"It handles everything we throw at it and just keeps working, flawlessly.  It's almost invisible from an administrative perspective.  It handles huge quantities of data, and it has all of the goodies that we expect in a relational database (such as referential integrity, column-level constraints and checks, server-side functions, subselects and unions).  The original 8.1 release, which came out in November 2005, included a number of new features, such as two-phase commits.  We can't recommend PostgreSQL highly enough."

			"More and more organizations are working with high-end database systems but can't afford, or don't want, a full-time database administrator. PostgreSQL complies with SQL standards but needs less babysitting than complicated legacy databases. Ludovic calls it, "easy to install, configure and relatively easy to tune for performance." In our June 2005 issue, he covered Slony-I, which adds replication to PostgreSQL, giving you multisite redundancy, increased performance or both. Reuven points out that PostgreSQL has programmer-friendly features, which for 8.0, include server-side scripting in Perl."

			"It's rare for any kind of sizable organization to not use a database for anything, and to that end, PostgreSQL provides a very reliable solution for Linux users. Sporting many advanced features missing from other available database packages, PostgreSQL is a perennial favorite for many of our developers. "
