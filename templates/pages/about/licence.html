<h2>Why not the GNU General Public License?</h2>

<p>
  People often ask why PostgreSQL is not released under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html" target="_blank">GNU General
Public License</a>. The simple answer is: we like our license and do not
want to change it!

<h2>Will PostgreSQL ever be released under a different license?</h2>
<p>
  The PostgreSQL Global Development Group remains committed to making
  PostgreSQL available as free and open source software in perpetuity. There are
  no plans to change the PostgreSQL License or release PostgreSQL under a
  different license.
