<h2>Interactive installer by EDB</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads"> Download the installer</a>
 certified by EDB for all supported PostgreSQL versions.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note!</strong> This installer is hosted by EDB and not on the PostgreSQL community servers.
  If you have issues with the website it's hosted on, please contact
  <a href="mailto:webmaster@enterprisedb.com">webmaster@enterprisedb.com</a>.
</p>

<p>This installer includes the PostgreSQL server, pgAdmin; a graphical tool for managing and developing
your databases, and StackBuilder; a package manager that can be used to download and install
additional PostgreSQL tools and drivers. Stackbuilder includes management,
integration, migration, replication, geospatial, connectors and other tools.
</p>

<p>
This installer can run in graphical or silent install modes.
</p>

<p>
The installer is designed to be a straightforward, fast way to get up and running with
PostgreSQL on Windows, however in the unlikely event that you do have any issues with
the installers, please report them on the <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-installers/issues">
installer Github page</a>. Issues with the installed packages should be reported to the
appropriate project directly.
</p>

<p>
<em>Advanced users</em> can also download a
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries">zip archive</a>
of the binaries, without the installer.
This download is intended for users who wish to include PostgreSQL as part of another application installer.
</p>

<h3>Platform support</h3>

<p>The installers are tested by EDB on the following platforms.
    They can generally be expected to run on other comparable versions,
    for example, desktop releases of Windows:</p>
