<h2>Interactive installer by EDB</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads"> Download the installer</a>
 certified by EDB for all supported PostgreSQL versions.
</p>

<p>This installer includes the PostgreSQL server, pgAdmin; a graphical tool for managing and developing
your databases, and StackBuilder; a package manager that can be used to download and install
additional PostgreSQL tools and drivers. Stackbuilder includes management,
integration, migration, replication, geospatial, connectors and other tools.
</p>

<p>
This installer can run in graphical or silent install modes.
</p>

<p>
The installer is designed to be a straightforward, fast way to get up and running with
PostgreSQL on Windows.
</p>

<p>
<em>Advanced users</em> can also download a
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries">zip archive</a>
of the binaries, without the installer.
This download is intended for users who wish to include PostgreSQL as part of another application installer.
</p>

<h3>Platform support</h3>

<p>The installers are tested by EDB on the following platforms.
    They can generally be expected to run on other comparable versions,
    for example, desktop releases of Windows:</p>
