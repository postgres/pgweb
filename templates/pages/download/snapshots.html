<h1>Beta/RC Releases and Development snapshots (unstable)</h1>

<p>
Beta and Release Candidate packages are built prior to the release of
new major versions of PostgreSQL. They are not built continually.
</p>

<p>
Development snapshots are built from the latest source code and
alpha/beta/rc versions that the developers are working on.
These are 'bleeding edge' versions of PostgreSQL and
<font color="red"><b>should not be used in production systems</b></font>
as they have had little or no testing or quality control.
</p>

<p>
The latest development version of the documentation is also 
<a href="/docs/devel/static/index.html">available online</a>.
</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>
Beta and Release Candidate tarballs are <a href="/ftp/source/">made available
alongside</a> the release tarballs during the final phases of the development
cycle of new major versions of PostgreSQL.
</p>

<p>
Source code tarballs are built automatically every night on the official
PostgreSQL development server. The
<a href="/ftp/snapshot/dev/">development snapshot</a> is taken from the
head of the git repository, and includes the new features being worked
on for the next release. There are also "branch tip" snapshots built from
all supported <a href="/ftp/snapshot/">stable branches</a>, which contains
all bugfixes that are scheduled for the next release.
</p>

<h2>RedHat, CentOS, Fedora and ScientificLinux</h2>
<p>
RPMs for RedHat, CentOS, Fedora and ScientificLinux are available from the
<a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Yum repository</a>.
</p>
<p>
To setup the repository for these versions, follow the same instructions
as for the <a href="/download/linux/redhat/">normal</a> yum repository on these
platforms.
</p>

<p>
Typically only Beta and Release Candidate packages are available in the
Yum repository.
</p>

<h2>Ubuntu Linux</h2>
<p>
DEBs for Ubuntu are available from the
<a href="https://launchpad.net/~pitti/+archive/postgresql">Ubuntu backports PPA</a>
repository.
</p>
<p>
To setup the repository for these versions, follow the same instructions
as for the <a href="/download/linux/ubuntu/">normal</a> PPA repository.
</p>
<p>
Typically only Beta and Release Candidate packages are available in
the PPA repository.
</p>


<h2>One click installer</h2>
<p>
One click installers are available for 32 and 64 bit Linux distributions,
Mac OS X and Windows and include PostgreSQL, pgAdmin and the PL/pgSQL
debugger plugin.
</p>

<p>
Typically only Beta and Release Candidate packages are available in
the installer distribution.
</p>

<p><b>Note: The one click installers do not integrate with platform-specific packaging systems on Linux. If you need
RPM packages for CentOS, Fedora or RHEL please use the packages above.</b></p>
