<h1>Beta/RC Releases and Development snapshots (unstable) <img class="logo" src="/media/img/about/press/elephant.png" alt="PostgreSQL Elephant Logo" /></h1>

<p>
Beta and Release Candidate packages are built prior to the release of
new major versions of PostgreSQL. They are not built continually.
</p>

<p>
Development snapshots are built from the latest source code and
beta/rc versions that the developers are working on.
These are 'bleeding edge' versions of PostgreSQL and
<span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">should not be used in production systems</span>
as they have had little or no testing or quality control.
</p>

<p>
The latest development version of the documentation is also
<a href="/docs/devel/index.html">available online</a>.
</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>
Beta and Release Candidate tarballs are <a href="/ftp/source/">made available
alongside</a> the release tarballs during the final phases of the development
cycle of new major versions of PostgreSQL.
</p>

<p>
Source code tarballs are built automatically every night on the official
PostgreSQL development server. The
<a href="/ftp/snapshot/dev/">development snapshot</a> is taken from the
head of the git repository, and includes the new features being worked
on for the next release. There are also "branch tip" snapshots built from
all supported <a href="/ftp/snapshot/">stable branches</a>, which contains
all bugfixes that are scheduled for the next release.
</p>
