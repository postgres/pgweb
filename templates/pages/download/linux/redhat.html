<h1>Linux downloads (RedHat/CentOS/Fedora/Scientific)</h1>
<p>
PostgreSQL is available on these platforms by default. However,
each version of the platform normally "snapshots" a specific version of
PostgreSQL that is then supported throughout the lifetime of this platform.
Since this can often mean a different version than preferred, the PostgreSQL
project provides a repository of packages of all supported versions.
</p>
<p>
Should packages not be available for your distribution, or there are
issues with your package manager, there are graphical installers available.
</p>
<p>
Finally, most Linux systems make it easy to build from source.
</p>

<h2>Included in distribution</h2>
<p>
These distributions all include PostgreSQL by default. To install
PostgreSQL from these repositories, use the <i>yum</i> command:
</p>
<p>
<code>
yum install postgresql
</code>
</p>
<p>
Which version of PostgreSQL you get will depend on the version of
the distribution:
<div class="tblBasic">
 <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tblBasicGrey">
  <tr>
   <th class="colFirst">Distribution</th>
   <th class="colLast">Version</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="colFirst">RHEL/CentOS/SL 5</td>
   <td class="colLast">8.1 (also supplies package postgresql84)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="colFirst">RHEL/CentOS/SL 6</td>
   <td class="colLast">8.4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td class="colFirst">Fedora 16, 17</td>
   <td class="colLast">9.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="lastrow">
   <td class="colFirst">Fedora 18</td>
   <td class="colLast">9.2</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
</div>
</p>

<p>
The repository contains many different packages including third party
addons. The most common and important packages are (substitute the
version number as required):
</p>
<ul>
 <li>postgresql - client libraries and client binaries</li>
 <li>postgresql-server - core database server</li>
 <li>postgresql-contrib - additional supplied modules</li>
 <li>postgresql-devel - libraries and headers for C language development</li>
 <li>pgadmin3 - pgAdmin III graphical administration utility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post-installation</h3>
<p>
Due to policies for RedHat style distributions, the PostgreSQL installation
will not be enabled for automatic start or have the database initialized
automatically. To make your database installation complete, you need to
perform these two steps:
<code>
service postgresql initdb<br/>
chkconfig postgresql on
</code>
</p>

<h2>PostgreSQL Yum Repository</h2>
<p>
If the version supplied by your operating system is not the one you want,
you can use the PostgreSQL Yum Repository. This repository will integrate
with your normal systems and patch management, and provide automatic
updates for all supported versions of PostgreSQL throughout the support
<a href="/support/versioning/">lifetime</a> of PostgreSQL.
</p>
<p>
To use the yum repository, you must first install the <i>repository RPM</i>.
To do this, download the correct RPM from the
<a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php">repository RPM listing</a>,
and install it with commands like:
</p>
<p>
<code>
rpm -i http://yum.postgresql.org/9.2/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-redhat92-9.2-7.noarch.rpm
</code>
</p>
<p>
Once this is done, you can proceed to install and update packages the
same way as the ones included in the distribution.
</p>
<p>
<code>
yum install postgresql92-server postgresql92-contrib<br/>
service postgresql-9.2 initdb<br/>
chkconfig postgresql-9.2 on
</code>
</p>
<p>
Package names in the
PostgreSQL yum repository follows the same standard as the ones included
in the main repositories, but include the version number, such as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>postgresql92</li>
 <li>postgresql92-server</li>
 <li>postgresql92-contrib</li>
 <li>pgadmin3_92</li>
</ul>

<h2>Direct RPM download</h2>
<p>
If you cannot, or do not want to, use the yum based installation method,
all the RPMs that are in the yum repository are available for
<a href="http://yum.postgresql.org/rpmchart.php">direct download</a>
and manual installation as well.
