<h1>Linux downloads (SuSE)</h1>
<p>
PostgreSQL is available in all SuSE versions by default. However, the
SuSE "snapshots" a specific version of PostgreSQL
that is then supported throughout the lifetime of that SuSE version.
</p>
<p>
Should packages not be available for your distribution, or there are
issues with your package manager, there are graphical installers available.
</p>
<p>
Finally, most Linux systems make it easy to build from source.
</p>

<h2>Included in distribution</h2>
<p>
RPMs for SUSE Linux and openSUSE are available from the
<a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">openSUSE Build Service</a>
in the project <i>server:database:postgresql</i>.
Platform-specific RPM packages are available for PostgreSQL
as well as a variety of related software.
Use the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/search">search facility</a>
to find suitable packages. Documentation is also available there.
