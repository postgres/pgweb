<h1>Solaris packages</h1>

<p>
Binary packages for Solaris can be downloaded from the solaris subdirectory
of the version you require from our <a href="/ftp/binary/">file browser</a>.
</p>

<p>Packages for Solaris 10 and 11 are available for Sparc and i386 platforms.</p>

<p>Although produced by Oracle (previously Sun), these packages are not officially supported by them.</p>

<p>Solaris packages are installed by unpacking the compressed tar files
directly into the install directory; see the README files for details.</p>
