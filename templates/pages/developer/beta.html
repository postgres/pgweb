<h1>Beta Information <i class="fa fa-code"></i></h1>

<p>PostgreSQL beta and release candidate releases are pre-release testing
    versions before the community makes a new release generally available. They
    are feature-frozen (i.e. no new features are added), and we release these to
    the public for testing before our final release. PostgreSQL beta and
    release candidate release are <strong>not meant for use in production
    systems</strong>.</p>

<p>Betas and release candidates are made available to the community in order to
    perform testing before the initial release. They are especially helpful
    for developers of platforms, drivers, tools, and utilities which depend upon
    PostgreSQL in order to prepare for changes in the new version. A release
    candidate should be identical to the initial release of a new major version
    of PostgreSQL, though additional changes could be made before the release is
    made generally available.</p>

<p>The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on the community to
    test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing tools in order to
    find bugs and regressions before the initial release. The quality of user
    testing helps determine when we can make a final release.</p>

<p>The PostgreSQL Global Development Group strongly advises against using beta
    versions of PostgreSQL in production installations or active development
    projects. While the PostgreSQL code is continuously subject to a number of
    automated and manual tests, beta releases might have serious bugs. Features
    are subject to changes that are backwards incompatible at any time during
    the development of the betas, and could possibly be removed altogether.</p>
