<h1>Alpha Information</h1>

<p>
PostgreSQL alpha releases are snapshots of development code.  They are
intended to preview and test upcoming features and to provide the
possibility for early feedback.  They should not be used in production
installations or active development projects.  While the PostgreSQL
code is continuously subject to a number of automated and manual
tests, alpha releases might have serious bugs.  Also features may be
changed incompatibly or removed before beta releases.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 9.5 is now in beta, so there will be no additional alpha 
releases until PostgreSQL 9.6.
</p>
<p>We depend on our large community of users to test the features in alpha
 releases and report issues.  If you are able to contribute to PostgreSQL by
doing alpha testing, please see our 
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/HowToBetaTest">Alpha/Beta Testing Page.</a></p>
