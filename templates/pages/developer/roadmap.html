<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<p>PostgreSQL is a non-commercial, all volunteer, free software project, and as
such there is no formal list of feature requirements required for development.
We really do follow the mantra of letting developers scratch their own itches.
</p>


<h2>Upcoming minor releases</h2>
<p>
The PostgreSQL project aims to make <i>at least</i> one minor release every quarter,
on a predefined schedule. If it becomes necessary due to an important bugfix or
security issue, more releases will be made between these dates, so this list should
be considered a minimum. At each of these dates, a new minor release will be made
for each <a href="/support/versioning/">supported version</a>.
</p>
<p>
The target date for these releases are, unless otherwise stated, the second
Thursday of February, May, August, and November. The current schedule for upcoming
releases is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>May 10th, 2018</li>
  <li>August 9th, 2018</li>
  <li>November 8th, 2018</li>
  <li>February 14th, 2019</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next major release</h2>

<p>The next major release of PostgreSQL is planned to be the 11 release. A
tentative schedule for this version has a release in the
third quarter of 2018.</p>

are several places you can look to find out more information on upcoming
features:</p>
